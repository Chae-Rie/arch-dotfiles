-- You can add your own plugins here or in other files in this directory!
--  I promise not to create any merge conflicts in this directory :)
--
-- See the kickstart.nvim README for more information
-- Note: This file does currently NOTHING it doesnt even get mentionend elsewhere.
-- You have to uncomment the line regarding which is like:
-- (import = 'customs.plugins'),
-- in the init.lua-File in the root directory to use the stuff in here.
-- Keep on using the big file there first before you start bringing modularity in this.
